# COUPLED NONLINEAR SCHRODINGER EQUATION
In this project, I analyze a nonlinear coupled schrodinger system which is found in the context of optical light propagation by deriving two numeric techniques, that is the Split-Step Fourier method (SSFM) and the implicit finite-difference method, the so-called Crank-Nicolson scheme. The analysis shows interesting dynamics regarding certain coupling constant value where small values produces colliding solitons that superimpose to each other and decompose back to their orginal state whereas large values produces solitons that are non-colliding. We also conclude that the Split-Step method is lot more faster and efficent than the Crank-Nicolson scheme which takes a considerabily long time to produce solitons of the same accuracy as the SSF method. This yields me to conclude that Split-Step Fourier Scheme (SSFM) is superior for this problem.
